She has a fair amount of knowledge about technology, just enough to not be afraid to ask for clarification on how things fit into the larger picture or to call the teacher out for being vague or misleading. Mara helps Aoi get up to speed with some topics. Mara is a shark with brown hair that has a red streak.",

They help Mara with answers to questions about details to the topics being discussed and work well with Numa due to being friends for a very long time. Cadey is an orcadragon with pink hair.",

Born in the fires of shitposting and satire, Numa genuinely does care about the topics being discussed, but has a bad habit of communicating in shitposts, memes, and hot takes intentionally designed to make you reconsider how serious she is being about any given topic. She could definitely be a wonderful teacher if she could lessen up a bit on the satire. The stickers for Numa are 3d renders of the author's v-tubing avatar, but Numa is written differently than the characterization of the author when streaming. Numa is a fairly tall (6') human with neon green hair that usually wears it in a high ponytail.",
