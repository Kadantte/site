That meme is not an understatement, [Anubis](https://anubis.techaro.lol) has been deployed by the United Nations.

For your amusement, here is how the inner monologue of me finding out about this went:

<ConvP>
  <Conv name="Aoi" mood="wut">
    What. You can't be serious, can you?
  </Conv>
  <Conv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
    [It's real](https://policytoolbox.iiep.unesco.org/).
  </Conv>
  <Conv name="Aoi" mood="wut">
    No, that can't be a real domain of the United Nations, can it?
  </Conv>
  <Conv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">
    [Wikipedia lists `unesco.org`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO) as the
    official domain of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
    Organization. I'm pretty sure it's real.
  </Conv>
  <Conv name="Aoi" mood="sus">
    No way. No fucking way. What the heck, how is this real. What is YOUR
    LIFE??? God I got the worst 2025 bingo card this year.
  </Conv>

I hate to shake my can and ask for donations, but if you are using Anubis and it helps, please [donate on Patreon](https://patreon.com/cadey). I would really love to not have to work in generative AI anymore because the doublethink is starting to wear at my soul.

Also, do I happen to know anyone at UNESCO? I would love to get in touch with their systems administrator team and see if they had any trouble with setting it up. I'm very interested in making it easier to install.

This makes the big deployments that I know about include:

- The Linux Kernel Mailing List archives
- FreeBSD's SVN (and soon git)
- SourceHut
- FFmpeg
- Wine
- UNESCO
- The Science Olympiad Student Center
- Enlightenment (the desktop environment)

The conversation I'm about to have with my accountant is going to be one of the most surreal conversations of all time.

The part that's the most wild to me is when I stop and consider the scale of these organizations. I think that this means that the problem is _much worse_ than I had previously anticipated. I know that at some point YouTube was about to hit "the inversion" where they get more bot traffic than they get human traffic. I wonder how much this is true across most of, if not all of the Internet right now.

I guess this means that I really need to start putting serious amounts of effort into Anubis and the stack around it. The best way that can be ensured is if I can get enough money to survive so I can put my full time effort into it. I may end up hiring people.

This is my life now. Follow me [on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/xeiaso.net) if you want to know when the domino meme gets more ridiculous!
