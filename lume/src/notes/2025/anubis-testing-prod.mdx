Hey all!

Anubis has really been taking off to the point that it has [its own repo now](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis). I'm going to be doing more work on it, but for right now what I really need is data. In order to get this data, I need you to let me know what I just broke by turning on Anubis in prod.

What I know broke:

- Discord link resolving (still working on fixing this, but I wanted to get this post out first)
- Twitter link resolving

If I missed something, [contact me](/contact/).
